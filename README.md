# 8086-Microprocessor
8086 Microprocessor Instruction Simulator

Welcome to the 8086 Microprocessor Instruction Simulator, a C-based implementation that emulates the behavior of basic 8086 instructions. This program is designed for enthusiasts, students, and developers who want to understand and experiment with the functionality of 8086 assembly instructions in a simulated environment.

- **Features**

**Supported Instructions**

    Data Transfer: MOV, PUSH, POP, XCHG

    Arithmetic Operations: ADD, SUB, INC, DEC, MUL, DIV

    Logical and Bit Manipulation: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, ROL, ROR, RCL, RCR

    Flag Handling: Automatically updates flags (CF, ZF, SF, etc.) for operations

**Simulation Highlights**

  Implements general-purpose registers (AX, BX, CX, DX) and pointer/index registers (SP, BP, SI, DI)

  Memory management through an array simulating memory (memory[100])



- **Getting Started**

Prerequisites

    - A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)

    - Basic knowledge of 8086 assembly language


- **Installation**

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/KiranBiju19/8086-Microprocessor-Tool-kit-Simulator.git
    
Navigate to the project directory:

    cd 8086-simulator

Compile the program:

    gcc 8086Microprocessor.c -o simulator

Run the executable:

    ./simulator

- **Usage**

**Example Instructions**

Below are some example models that demonstrate the functionality of the simulator:

_**Data Transfer**_

    MOV AX, 1234H   ; Move immediate data into AX
    MOV [BX], AX    ; Move AX into memory location pointed by BX
    PUSH AX         ; Push AX onto the stack
    POP BX          ; Pop the value from the stack into BX
    HLT

_**Arithmetic Operations**_
      
      ADD AX, BX      ; Add BX to AX
      SUB CX, 0001H   ; Subtract immediate value from CX
      INC DX          ; Increment DX by 1
      DEC AX          ; Decrement AX by 1
      HLT

_**Logical/Bit Manipulation**_

    ROL AX, 1       ; Rotate AX left by 1 bit
    ROR BX, 2       ; Rotate BX right by 2 bits
    HLT

_**Advanced Example**_

    MOV AX, 0003H   ; Load immediate data into AX
    ADD AX, [SI]    ; Add value at memory location pointed by SI to AX
    MOV [BX], AX    ; Store AX at memory location pointed by BX
    HLT

_**Control Transfer Instruction**_
            mov cx,#6
            mov ax, #0000
            mov [ax],#0001
            inc ax
            loop 3
            hlt

**Testing**

Example Test Cases

The following test cases help validate the simulator's functionality:

Data Transfer Validation:

    MOV AX, 0x1234
    MOV [10H], AX
    MOV BX, [10H]
    HLT

Expected Result: BX = 0x1234

Arithmetic Operations:

    MOV AX, 0x0001
    ADD AX, 0x0002
    HLT

Expected Result: AX = 0x0003

Logical Operations:

    MOV AX, 0x0F0F
    ROL AX, 4
    HLT

Expected Result: AX = 0xF0F0

Flag Testing:

    MOV AX, 0xFFFF
    INC AX
    HLT

Expected Result: AX = 0x0000, ZF = 1


Guidelines for Coding with the Simulator

- **Instruction Syntax**

  -  _Ensure proper case and format for instructions, e.g., MOV AX, 1234H_

  - _Separate operands with a comma._

  - _Use hexadecimal notation for immediate values (e.g., 1234H)._

  - _Use the line number along with the Conditional Control Instructions._
 
  - _Must use HLT at the end of the code._

  Memory Access

  -  _Ensure memory indices are within bounds (0 <= index < 100)._

  - _Use valid registers or pointers for indirect memory access._

  Debugging

   -  _Print register states using printf after each operation to verify intermediate values._


Extending the Simulator

Adding New Instructions: Add logic to the corresponding function (e.g., data_transfer, arithmetic).

Improving Flag Handling: Update flags in each operation as per 8086 behavior.

- **Future Enhancements**

  -  String Manipulation Instructions: Add support for MOVS, LODS, STOS.
    
  -  Control Flow Instructions: Implement CALL and RET.
    
  -  Iteractive User Input: Allow users to input instructions at runtime.
